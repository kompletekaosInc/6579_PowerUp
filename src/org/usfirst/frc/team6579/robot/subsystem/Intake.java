/**
 * This class is responsible for the intake mechanism on the robot
 * The intake is used to obtain power cubes from the field into the robot
 *
 * The intake has x motors, and y limits/sensors
 * PORTS:
 * motorA = PWM port b roboRIO, port c PDP
 * sensorX = Analog port y & z roboRIO
 * ToDo: put actual ports for intake here
 *
 * This mechanism will be mostly controlled by the Operator
